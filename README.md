# Icicle Dodging Simulator

## Todo List

- [x] randomly drop icicles from top of screen
- [x] collision detection for icicles x player avatar
- [x] on the above collision, increase score logically and visually
- [x] advance to Play state on space key press
- [x] map left / right player avatar movement to left / right arrow keys
- [x] map impact sound to icicle collision with player avatar
- [x] add sounds for win and lose states
- [x] name of zip = subject

## Reach Goals

- [x] refactor code for proper inheretance across scopes (eliminate as many global vars as possible)
- [x] scale icicle drop velocity exponentially as timer drops
- [x] scale icicle drop interval to remaining game time (uses recursion ðŸ˜Ž)
- [ ] dynamic spritesheet on eskimo.png (player avatar movement)
- [ ] dynamic spritesheet on ice.png (dropping icicles)
